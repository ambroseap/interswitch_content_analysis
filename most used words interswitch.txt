At a time when most people believed

#Nigeria’s infrastructural challenges were too great to overcome, we took a bet as Interswitch Group to push the boundaries of digital payment innovation against all the odds, ultimately helping entrench the country as a global reference-point in seamless real-time payments💱 ...

From building out enterprise infrastructural rails that essentially power interconnected banking, payments & fintech ecosystems, to progressively layering consumer value added services (VAS) platforms such as

#Quickteller on those rails, and then daring to pioneer a home-grown

#EMV payment card scheme 💳 out of

#Africa, one that comfortably holds it own in the global sphere 💪🏽, in Verve International, we're not one to rest on our oars; we continue to advance our aspirations of democratizing digital financial services across the continent...

All of these anchored firmly on our vivid vision of a prosperous Africa, driven by seamless exchange of

InterswitchSPAK National Science Competition Season 6.0 Episode 9 Live
Some weeks ago, I participated in a panel session at Interswitch Group Tech Connect 4.0 alongside Akeem Lawal, moderated by Adaobi Igwe-Okerekeocha. In this session, we explored the balance between regulating new technologies, implementing strategies for innovation and compliance, harmonizing regulatory frameworks, and adopting risk-based approaches.

During the discussion, I shared my thoughts on how reliability will remain king even as the fintech industry evolves. No matter how innovative our products become, earning trust through reliability will always be a priority. I also highlighted the importance of using our products as a bridge between innovators and regulators. A good product can foster collaboration and understanding, ensuring that both sides align to move the industry forward.

More importantly, self-regulation must become a core principle in fintech. As industry players, we need to be able to call ourselves to order and address challenges internally before they escalate into issues with regulators. A proactive approach like this helps build trust and demonstrates accountability.

Beyond the initial hype, the impending realities are frankly starting to get startling for most, from industry experts to casual observers, particularly in the wake of recent revelations from a notable global big tech player that by as soon as this year (2025), there are plans to replace mid-level software engineers with AI!😯

Against the backdrop of these interesting and unprecedented sea-changes, we consolidate our partnership with AI In Nigeria to support the 2nd edition of the Innovate AI Conference (2025); diving deeper and pushing new frontiers into the outlook for Artificial Intelligence, particularly the implications of these recent & emerging developments for our

In her keynote address, Titilola Shogaolu, Managing Director, Interswitch Financial Inclusion Services (IFIS), drawing from Winston Churchill, reminded the competition's finalists (and indeed all the 16,000+ participants who entered the National Qualifying Exams) that 'beyond awards and accolades, that real victory lies in growth - learning to think critically, work collaboratively, and remain curious...whilst never doubting your ability to make a difference in the world!'

For us here at

#TheSwitch💡 we will remain committed to supporting and championing STEM education across Africa, underpinned by our conviction that through platforms like this, we are empowering a new generation of innovators who will lead Africa into a new era of development and prosperity!

Interswitch Group Founder/CEO, Mitchell Elegbe shared leadership insights in '𝗖𝗘𝗢 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗶𝘅 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗶𝘀𝗵 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘁', co-authored by McKinsey & Company Senior Partners, Vik Malhotra, Carolyn Dewar and Scott Keller, the trio of whom led a research effort to identify those CEOs whose companies grew demonstrably healthier during their tenures.

Mitchell's perspectives, captured in the book, on the difference between 'victory' and 'winning' resonate, and have significantly shaped our core values and business philosophy at Interswitch...

#TheSwitch💡, we're doubling down on celebrating 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗲 𝗨𝘀!🌸

So, yesterday in the heart of

#Nairobi🇰🇪, we brought together a cross-section of our

#WomenOfTheSwitch💜 for a close-knit breakfast and fireside session, where we hosted as guest speaker and panellist, the amazing Dr. Zippy Okoth (PhD); author, performing artist, award-winning director & producer and all-round creative powerhouse, whose journey of resilience, courage and discipline continues to inspire! 🚀 .

The conversations threw up priceless gems of insight on owning our stories, making the most of self-awareness, setting goals and accelerating action towards achieving them and never letting circumstances limit our dreams and ambitions!🔥

Throughout this month, as we celebrate the uniqueness and impact of women, we're dialling up our commitment at Interswitch Group towards empowering women, not only directly within our workforce, but as well, across our entire ecosystem, playing our part in actualizing a society where women continue to rise and thrive - Together, we will drive the change and progress we desire to see!📈

#AcceleratingAction🚀
It's the Monday after IWD, and like us, you've probably observed a flurry of mixed feelings and reactions over the weekend 🤔...

Understandably from all the recent global upheavals regarding 'DEI', as well the sustenance of heavily entrenched patriarchal structures across many societies, the cynicism and scepticism of many observers are not out of place, triggered by the feeling that many organizations, institutions and leaders are largely 'white-washing' - merely paying lip service to the true empowerment of women in society...

But here's the thing; the case for constant advocacy remains strong, as much as there's an even stronger one for affirmative action. The reality is that we cannot afford to give in to despondency and cease conversing and engaging on these critical issues!

There simply can't be too many events and talk-shops, because advocacy in itself plays a significant role in making voices heard, educating the wider community, subtly influencing laws and policies and consistently fostering awareness and respect for the cause.

Here at

#TheSwitch💡, we're actively championing these relevant & vital conversations, but more essentially, playing our part and accelerating actions that reinforce our talk, within our spheres of influence...so join us on the 20th of March, in partnership with BusinessDay Conferences, themed around

#InspirationToAction, featuring inspiring female professionals & leaders like Oremeyi Adeola Akah, Adesuwa Jamilla Belo-Osagie, Bisi Sotunde(nee Padonu), Dr. Glory Edozien (PhD), Abiola Adediran, MBA, FCA, FIMC, CMC and Dr. Odiri Oginni, DBA, CFA 💐

Let's all commit towards backing up all the conversations (and ideals) with meaningful action, even if it means taking measured and modular steps!📈

Following the success of our pilot, we’re thrilled to kick off the Interswitch Job Shadowing Program once again. This initiative will equip professionals with hands-on training, mentorship, and industry insights across engineering, product management, marketing, finance, and more.

At its core, the program reflects Interswitch's unwavering commitment to cultivating talent and fostering innovation within Africa’s tech ecosystem. By bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, we’re empowering participants with the skills, insights, and mentorship needed to thrive in today’s dynamic workplace.

For three months, participants will immerse themselves in training, learning industry best practices, emerging trends, and gaining hands-on experience from seasoned professionals and tech industry experts alike.

The demand for growth opportunities in Africa’s tech space is undeniable, and we’re proud to be part of the solution.
